# BeagleTouch_Animation


A project involving interfacing `Capacacitive Touch sensor (CY8C401)` with the BeagleBone Green's I2C driver and controlling an user space application using the sensor created with `ANSI_ANIM` lib

## About ansilib

Ansilib is a tiny lib meant for some neat and simple command-line based graphics. It can render rectangles, triangles and squares as of now.
The features of the shape can be independently modified to give different color/character for border area or fill area.
![Click here](https://github.com/CodeOn-ArK/ansi_anim) to know about the ANSI lib.

## `Linux System Programming` and the `project`

This project is a small effort to test out system programming in Linus using the widely available `BeagleBone Green` hardware.
It interfaces with a `capacitive touch panel` based on `cy8c401`  to read user data via the touch pads
